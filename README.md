1. # Bank Statement Extractor - End-to-End Generative AI Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end Bank Statement Extractor using Google Gemini (Generative AI) and Streamlit. The user can upload a bank statement image and provide a prompt, and the model will respond with relevant information based on the image and prompt.

## Project Flow

1. **Input Prompt**: The user provides an input text (query) related to the bank statement.
2. **Upload Image**: The user uploads an image of the bank statement (JPG, PNG, JPEG).
3. **Google Generative AI Model**: The uploaded image and input prompt are sent to Google Gemini, which generates a response based on the provided input.
4. **Response**: The model's generated response is displayed in the Streamlit app.

## Features
- **User Input**: Allows the user to input a custom query.
- **Image Upload**: Accepts image files of type JPG, PNG, or JPEG.
- **Generative AI**: Uses Google Gemini (Generative AI) to generate responses based on the input and uploaded image.
